    <h4>Who I am</h4>
    <p>The first time I have coded was in 2006 on Matlab, as I was in preparatory classes for engineer schools. Since then, programming has kept waving at me (statistics on R in engineer school, projects on VBA an SQL during internships). Today, I am a proud junior dev who just finished Le Wagon intensive FullStack bootcamp! I am driven by great team work and the satisfaction you get after having spent energy on a clean and DRY code that works!</p>
